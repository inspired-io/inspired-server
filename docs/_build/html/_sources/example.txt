 Example
=========

----------
 Hi there
----------

This is a Title
===============
That has a paragraph about a main subject and is set when the '='
is at least the same length of the title itself.

Subject Subtitle
----------------
Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length
of the subtitle itself, just like titles.

Lists can be unnumbered like:

 * Item Foo
 * Item Bar

Or automatically numbered:

 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2

Inline Markup
-------------
Words can have *emphasis in italics* or be **bold** and you can define
code samples with back quotes, like when you talk about a command: ``sudo``
gives you super user powers!

Test
----
.. function:: $.getJSON(href, callback[, errback])

   :param string href: An URI to the location of the resource.
   :param callback: Gets called with the object.
   :param errback:
       Gets called in case the request fails. And a lot of other
       text so we need multiple lines.
   :throws SomeError: For whatever reason in that case.
   :returns: Something.


.. code-block:: coffeescript
   :linenos:

   class Test
       a: (@x, y, z) ->
           y * 2

   t = new Test
   t.a 5, 3, 1
